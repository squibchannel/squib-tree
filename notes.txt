Hashtag Generator

#TODO: Main Goals:
- Once a day grab top hashtags and display them
    - Check for a difference daily and don't call if x percentage
    - grab all top and copy to cliboard 

- Be able to enter keyword and display relevant hashtags
- Enter an image and display tags
-- be able to upload image (should we cache a few?)

#TODO: Small Goals
- Let others use their own api key for requests 


#FIXME: Auth Flow:

-- "/" The homepage is the "linktree" clone ie SquibTree
-- -- You do not need an authentication to access this

-- You may login with button and get redirected
-- -- If logged in then show "tools" and "dashboard"
-- -- -- If !apiKeys or required config for said tool or tools display dialog saying "please configure at dashboard"

-- -- Need some sort of personal dashboard that allows you to configure tools
-- -- Have a profile page that displays Twitch info
